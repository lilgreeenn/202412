                        <p class="important">The year <strong>2053</strong> marks a turning point in human history—a world rebuilt upon the foundation of "Memory Dust." This discovery, however, was born from the ashes of a catastrophic global conflict.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>The Catastrophic War and the Beginning of the Discovery</h3>
                    <div class="content-box">
                        <p>In 2025, the world descended into chaos as nations fought over dwindling resources in what came to be known as "The Great Collapse." This global war, driven by the depletion of fossil fuels, rare earth elements, and water resources, led to nuclear devastation and environmental collapse. Cities were reduced to rubble, ecosystems were destroyed, and human civilization was pushed to the brink. The war claimed over two-thirds of the global population, leaving behind survivors struggling to endure in a ruined landscape.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The Great Collapse</h4>
                        <p>The Great Collapse was a pivotal event in human history, marking the end of an era dominated by unsustainable consumption and geopolitical tensions. As fossil fuel reserves dwindled, nations became increasingly desperate, leading to aggressive territorial disputes and resource hoarding. The collapse of international trade networks exacerbated the crisis, causing widespread shortages of essential goods and services. In response, governments resorted to extreme measures, including the deployment of advanced weaponry, which further destabilized the global order.</p>
                        <p>Amidst the chaos, societal structures crumbled, and trust in traditional institutions eroded. The Great Collapse not only reshaped geopolitical boundaries but also forced humanity to confront the consequences of its actions. It served as a harsh reminder of the fragility of modern civilization and the urgent need for sustainable practices. The aftermath of the collapse set the stage for the discovery of Memory Dust, as scientists sought to salvage remnants of knowledge and culture from the ruins of the old world.</p>

                        <p>Two years after the war's end, while investigating contaminated battlefields and recovering remains, scientists observed a strange phenomenon: tiny, glowing particles seemed to hover around corpses. Initially mistaken for radioactive or environmental pollutants, these particles were eventually identified as something entirely unique—materialized remnants of neural activity from the deceased. These particles, later named <strong>"Memory Dust"</strong>, became one of humanity's most important discoveries.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>The Properties of Memory Dust</h3>
                    <div class="content-box">
                        <p>Memory Dust represents the externalization of human memory and emotion, preserved for a brief period after death. It possesses distinct characteristics that make it both invaluable and highly dangerous.</p>
                        
                        <h4><strong>1. The 12-Hour Active Window</strong></h4>
                        <p>For the first 12 hours after death, Memory Dust remains stable, floating in a solid form around the body. This period is called the "Golden Window of Extraction," during which the dust can be collected and preserved using specialized equipment. In this phase, it contains intact memories, emotions, and even entire life experiences, making it a precious resource.</p>
                        
                        <h4><strong>2. The Risks of Direct Contact</strong></h4>
                        <p>Direct contact with Memory Dust is perilous. When the dust enters the human body via skin contact, it integrates into the nervous system, introducing foreign memories and emotions. This causes <strong>cognitive dissonance</strong>, often resulting in:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Confusion about one's identity and memories</li>
                            <li>An inability to distinguish reality from hallucination</li>
                            <li>Total mental breakdown</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Studies reveal that 80% of individuals exposed to Memory Dust suffer irreversible neurological damage within hours.</p>
                        
                        <h4><strong>3. The Danger of Airborne Contamination</strong></h4>
                        <p>After the 12-hour window, Memory Dust begins to break apart, turning gaseous and spreading into the surrounding air. Inhaling airborne Memory Dust leads to severe memory contamination, as individuals unknowingly absorb fragments of memories from the deceased. This form of pollution transforms entire areas into <strong>"Memory Contamination Zones"</strong>, where prolonged exposure erases personal identity and replaces it with chaotic, overlapping fragments of alien experiences.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>How Memory Dust Reshaped Society</h3>
                    <div class="content-box">
                        <p>Initially, Memory Dust was seen as a hazardous byproduct of war, something to be contained and neutralized. However, its true significance became clear during early experiments. Scientists discovered that Memory Dust held not just the fragments of an individual's life but also the cumulative knowledge and emotions that defined humanity itself.</p>
                        
                        <blockquote class="researcher-quote">
                            <p>"When we first encountered Memory Dust, we were awestruck. This wasn't just a discovery—it was a portal into humanity's past. These particles were fragments of history, embers of emotion. We realized this could be humanity's lifeline in the face of extinction."</p>
                            <cite>— Dr. Elena Marcus, Head Scientist at Laboratory 0043</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        
                        <p>In a post-war world suffering from resource depletion, knowledge gaps, and cultural loss, Memory Dust was heralded as the key to reconstruction. By extracting, refining, and reusing the memories stored within these particles, humanity found a way to rebuild its knowledge base, restore lost expertise, and reconnect with its shared history.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Memory Dust: A Double-Edged Sword</h3>
                    <div class="content-box">
                        <p class="important">While Memory Dust brought hope and new possibilities for survival, it also introduced ethical dilemmas and unprecedented challenges. Its capacity to preserve and transmit memories made it a powerful tool, but its invasive nature posed significant risks. The potential for misuse became clear as Memory Dust evolved from a scientific marvel to a commodity and, ultimately, a means of societal control.</p>

                        <p>The Clone Program was born out of necessity. Traditional memory integration in living humans resulted in a 75% failure rate due to psychological rejection.</p>
                        <p>Clones are engineered as "blank slates" with no pre-existing memories or emotions, making them ideal vessels for Memory Dust storage.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Physical Design:</strong> Clones are biologically identical to humans but lack natural neural activity at birth.</li>
                            <li><strong>Memory Capacity:</strong> Clones can store up to 200% more memory than an average human without experiencing cognitive overload.</li>
                            <li><strong>Behavioral Programming:</strong> Clones are conditioned to perform specific tasks based on the type of memories injected into them.</li>
